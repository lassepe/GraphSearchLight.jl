**Notice:** This package uses some Julia 1.1 features and requires minor modifications to be used with older versions of Julia (mainly replace calls of `isnothing`).

## Installation

Simply run:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/lassepe/GraphSearchZero.jl"))
```

## Usage

A simple example of how to use this can be found in [test/test_search.jl](https://github.com/lassepe/GraphSearchZero.jl/blob/master/test/test_search.jl_).
This defines a simple grid world problem with obstacles with some cells being occupied by obstacles.

### Defining a `SearchProblem`

As you can see from this example, all you need to do is implement the `SearchProblem` interface defined in [src/problem_interface.jl](https://github.com/lassepe/GraphSearchZero.jl/blob/master/src/problem_interface.jl).
That is, you need to define a structure that inherits from `SearchProblem{S,A`}, where `S` is the state type and `A` is the action type.

```julia
"""
    SearchProblem

A minimalistic, simple interface for search problems
`S` - the state type
`A` - the action type
"""
abstract type SearchProblem{S, A} end
```

A `SearchProblem` must then implement each of the following functions:

```julia
"""
    start_state(p::SearchProblem)

Returns the start state of the problem.
"""
function start_state end
"""
    is_goal_state(p::SearchProblem, s::S)

Returns true if a given state is a goal state
"""
function is_goal_state end
"""
    successors(p::SearchProblem, s::S)

Returns a list of tuples `(sp, a, c)`, i.e. the next state, the action that
yields this state and the cost for this transition.
"""
function successors end

```

### Solving the Search Problem

Once you have specified your search problem, finding a solution to this problem is as simple as calling one of the solvers.
Currently, `generic_graph_search`, `weighted_astar` and `astar` are provided. The generic graph search method is provided that computes the solution given a `p::SearchProblem` and a `fringe_priority::Function`.
Here, the `fringe_priority` is a function that maps a `SearchNode{S, A}` to a scalar priority. The algorithm will expand nodes with a *low* priority first.
In order to use A* (`astar`), the user simply needs to provide a `heuristic::Function` that maps a state `s::S` to a scalar cost-to-go lower bound. Basically, `astar` is a convenience wrapper that calls `generic_graph_search` with the fringe priority mapping constructed from the `heuristic`.
`weighted_astar` uses a [bounded relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Bounded_relaxation) of the search problem to find a solution with an Îµ-environment of the optimal cost.
